## Inspiration
In this pandemic online shopping is at peak with that everyone compare prices on different apps, So taking this problem in consideration we got inspiration o make this app name **Juxtaprice**

## What it does
**Juxtaprice** take product and compare on the shopping sites and shows best matching results and there prices on different sites. So no need to download multiple apps to compare prices.
## What it means
JUXTAPOSE -> COMPARE
so compare prices stands for **JUXT A PRICE** --> **COMPARE A PRICE** 
## How we built it
1. Python Selenium
2. Android studio for App Development
3. NG Rock for deployment

## Challenges we ran into
Web scrapping and deployment to get API was very challenging.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of

## What we learned
We learned web scrapping which were new for all team members and came to know about different deployment platforms which are very good, and this helped for enhancing problem solving skill and read logs to find errors
## What's next for Juxtaprice
**Juxtaprice** will take **in app** ordering instead of going on any website or app to order product after comparison and this will be more challenging and fun for us.
